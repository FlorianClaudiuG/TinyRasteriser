# TinyRasteriser

Year 2 Computer Graphics assignment. We were provided a framework for a rasteriser which we were required to improve upon.

The framework provided included just the animated line following the cursor in the F1 test (completely white at the time), which would
only draw in one octant.

Everything from line drawing to scanlines and interpolation has been implemented by me in the "Rasterizer.cpp" file.

There are still a few bugs with the way alpha blending works due to some problems with the scanlines.
